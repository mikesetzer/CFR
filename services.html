          <h3>Retirement Services/Consulting</h3>
          <p>Chairvolotti Financial can partner with a retirement plan sponsor as an ERISA 3(21) advisor or take on the role of a 3(38) ERISA investment manager. As a 3(21) advisor we will provide investment recommendations. The plan sponsor will retain the ultimate decision making authority for the investments. There will be shared fiduciary responsibility for the investments.</p>

          <p>As a 3(38) ERISA fiduciary investment manager we will have responsibility to manage the plan’s assets. This will shift liability for the investments away from the plan sponsor. We will have full responsibility to select, monitor and replace investments as needed. A 3(38) fiduciary has “discretion” as a decision-maker as defined by ERISA. This does not absolve the plan sponsor completely of other fiduciary responsibilities.</p>
